Chauffeur
=========

Chauffeur is meant to represent a platform for building a community of drivers and owner operators looking to find and build relationships for the long term. Chauffeur will help drivers easily search and lease all Taxis, Hire cars, Buses, Limousines, and Trucks.

Objectives:
==========

1. Best place to find authorised or licensed professional drivers and maximise the operation of commercial vehicles.
2. Provide an easy way to update the rates for lease of commercial vehicles.
3. Allow drivers to easily search, find, compare rate offers from operators.
4. Allow these industry groups to advertise 
    - Taxis including all existing taxi services
    - Limousines and hire cars
    - Taxis and other transport related schools
    - Tours and public transport buses to advertise for drivers
    - Trucks including interstate transport
    - Vans, Couriers, Removals
5. Allow the public to find drivers for their private cars including angel drivers (those who drive you home when you had too many drinks)

Current process:
===============

1. Accredited drivers operate on their own and it is up to them to find owners operators to lease their vehicle. Typically they use the following methods:

    - Contact the taxi networks who will provide a series of phone numbers for owner operators.
    - Ask existing drivers about owner operators.

2. There are no guarantees the drivers find a car, especially one that is close to their location.

3. The process is similar across industries including Taxis, Hire cars, Limousines, Buses, etc.

4. The current process present uncertainties for owners and is time consuming for drivers.

5. This reality suggests that a better way to find, compare lease prices from owner operators is needed.
